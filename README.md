# 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of credit card applications every day. Evaluating every application manually is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent decisions.

This project uses **Machine Learning classification algorithms** to predict whether a credit card application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant information.

The application provides real-time predictions through a simple and interactive web interface built with **Flask**.
